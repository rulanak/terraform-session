## What is Terraform?
Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently.
***
## Why Terraform?
Terraform allows us create another version of infrastructure by pushing it to production stage to check and test if its up and running perfectly and then remove from production first (former) version of infrastructure. *it is a safer way to make changes on infrastructure than doing it with automation configuration tool (mutable infrastructure)*
